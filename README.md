# ABOUT
This is a repository set-up for collaborators to share ideas and grow the documentation/index on the project. The documentation will help inform future decision-making. The documentation ledger system will also allow us to identify who has made commits.

It's discovery stage - may get entirely abandoned.  There is a small amount of set-up required to understand version control under git. This learning curve may turn-off some participants or alienate those not familiar with git so that needs to be managed.
