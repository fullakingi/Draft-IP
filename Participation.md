# Participation Ideas

Read this cool idea and thought this kind of concept might be a good way to stimulate diversity in the community:

> Join us at ~~JAMstack_conf~~ Inner PLanet event in San Francisco, Oct 16-18
> JAMstack_conf kicks off next Wednesday, and we are giddy over the incredible speaker lineup: Mandy Michael, Sean Grove, Katie Sylor-Miller, Debbie O'Brien, Zach Leatherman, Chris Coyier, and many more. Thursday morning we'll host a breakfast and roundtable about the business advantages of JAMstack for agencies featuring Matter Supply Co (well-known for their Nike and Impossible Foods campaigns) and Therefore (powering major sites in Canada including Longos).

> Our goal is to make the JAMstack community as inclusive as possible, and we're especially proud `to provide more than 40 diversity tickets` for the San Francisco conference, thanks in part to our sponsor MemberSpace! If you're recruiting or looking for your next gig, JAMstack_conf is the place to be! Many of our sponsors are hiring. 

also this idea to give an overview of inner planet tech
